# Disque docker image

Disque is an in-memory, distributed job queue.

See [here](https://github.com/antirez/disque) for Disque documentation.

The Dockerfile for this image is based on the [official Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) image, since the build and run requirements are very similar.

This image is in Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/richnorth/disque/
